2024-12-29,2063,My Data Science Manifesto from a Self Taught Data Scientist,"As a stats professor who teaches DS, your point about evaluation is especially important with the rise in generative models. It was already a challenge getting DS students to think critically about the *practical* performance of their models before LLMs, and now model evaluation more important than ever.

While I agree that you don’t need to memorize all the statistical models and tests as long as you’re aware of where to find them and how to use them, I’ll add that it’s equally important to know *when* to reach for them. Too many students struggle with recognizing when a problem calls for statistical testing rather than classification. When all you know is ML, everything looks like a prediction problem.

And communication!!! If you can’t explain the relevance of your results to laypeople, you’re not going to be an effective data scientist.","The other big thing you didn't mention is recognizing the importance and different ways to clean and prepare data. Honestly, it shouldn't need to be said, but I just worked under a senior data scientist on a consulting gig that didn't think that step was important at all. I literally facepalmed watching them train a model on a dataset with over 50% null values and duplicates. Understanding the actual meaning and importance behind ""garbage in, garbage out"" should be the absolute bare minimum for any DS","Honestly, this is so refreshing to read and I appreciate you taking the time to write it.

2024-01-31,1705,Friendly reminder not to work too hard. You'll just get fired,"I'm in HR Workforce management,

Let me tell you, C-Suite usually only ask for Salaries by job profiles. That's it. No engagement scores, performance metrics, Management reviews. Nada. They rarely dig into the specifics of who you are as a person, rather the role you play in the company and what roles are ""expendable"".

It blows my mind how unscientific and how broad the brushstrokes are when they layoff people. It's literally the most awkward and clunky way to save money. It's as if Finance went through a car and started tearing up things they don't need with 0 knowledge of how a car actually works.

2024-02-27,1394,Data scientist quits her job at Spotify,You can’t manage a pushy stakeholder unless your boss supports you.,"> How do you manage a “pushy” stakeholder?

I'm a SWE, not a data scientist, but my answer for a case like this is quite simple.

Me: ""I'm struggling to meet the demands here. My understanding is that this is a very important and high priority initiative, is that right?""

Stakeholder: ""Yes, it's very high priority and urgent.""

Me: ""So why am I the only person who's working on it? Can we get more resources?""

Then the stakeholder is forced to either backtrack and admit that the urgency and priority isn't as high as they're making it out to be, or else is forced up the chain of command to provide additional resources.

If this seems confrontational, _it is_. If you work at a place where you feel afraid to have a direct conversation like this, you need to get out regardless.","This is not uncommon, especially for data scientists embedded into non-data teams as she was. Ultimately, stakeholders dont understand the time silent work takes (interpreting requirements, sourcing or even extracting data, due dilligence in data interpretation, data processing, storytelling, generating visualizations) as its outside their domain and have their own prios/deadlines to worry about. Tbf, I’m a DS and cant even properly estimate how long a request will take unless using data I produced or am super familiar with.         

Add on top, managing changing requirements and the enormous level of context switching between trying to do deep work and sporading meetings in all levels of the org (your immediate stakeholders, your team, company-wide, etc) and Slack messages. So, data scientists are asked for work beyond the time or mental bandwidth they have.         

The DS role can be VERY ambiguous and unstructured (even in good companies like Spotify), stories like this are the unfortunate consequence. I’m personally preparing myself to transition to slightly more structured job types within tech because each of my DS roles is completely different from the next, including in the tasks I do or the knowledge I’m expected to have."

And yes I know people who have had this turn out well for them. But being able to do the job is not the same as being able to land the job, and with the competition in the space right now I think young aspiring DS/DAs should approach this advice with caution.

MDs all go through a much more rigorous training, with credentialing, standardized testing, and peer review before getting to the job market. There’s just a baseline level of quality that can be expected of an MD that can’t reasonably be expected of all DS. It can reasonably be expected that any doctor has some set of medical skills. If a DS says they know something, it’s far less certain that they actually do. Now, there is certainly a subset of DS where these expectations hold, but not all employers can/will hire from that pool.","I… don’t really understand the horror since a huge part of physician training involves being “pimped” (not my term), which is exactly this - being asked on the spot for medical knowledge. ","As both a physician and data scientist, I'll say I wish physician interviews had at least some element of testing your professional capability.

At data orgs in small to mid sized companies, importance of offline evaluation and dataset construction is losing ground to throwing autoML pipelines at datasets with heavy sampling bias and LLM workflows with magic prompts that are blindly applied for domain specific tasks etc. 

I think due to above reason there’s the risk of DS products failing even more often and DS teams may start to get outsourced :(","I think you're missing the signals of this happening in politics worldwide. People are increasingly trapped in a race against time to profit as quick as possible. 


There is so much that can be said on this topic but for now this trend does not seem easily reversible and might even accelerate.","The DS team I’m in is exactly what you’re describing, except it is not a choice from leadership but due to the team’s statistical knowledge incompetency and motivation.

Don’t get me wrong. I do believe it is a challenge to earn trust for DS teams and business always require numbers to keep the team alive year after year.

The FOMO is mainly driven by two factors I think

1. What used to be months of work collecting labeled data, training and fine tuning models, deploying on kubernetes at scale, is currently just an API call away for many NLP problems. This tremendously speeds up development and requires a much smaller team to develop and maintain. Being lean is all the rage in the business world, hence the interest to capitulate on this

2. Endless “thought leadership” on how GenAI will disrupt and transform entire industries so everyone is afraid their business would get completely obliterated. The utter and complete destruction of the print media with the rise of the smartphone is fresh in most senior management’s memory and they don’t want the same thing happening to them this time.

BY Irina Ivanova, Fortune - May 18, 2025 at 7:03 AM EDT

AI chatbots have been rolled out across hundreds of white-collar workplaces, but on average, their effect on hours and pay has been negligible, according to a National Bureau of Economic Research working paper linking AI use to corporate records in Denmark. On average, employees saved 3% of their time, while just 3%-7% of their productivity gains came back to them in the form of higher pay.

Since OpenAI rolled out ChatGPT just over two years ago, AI chatbots have become the fastest-adopted technologies in history, rivaling the PC three decades ago. Their popularity has created and destroyed entire job descriptions and sent company valuations into the stratosphere—then back down to earth. 

And yet, one of the first studies to look at AI use in conjunction with employment data finds the technology’s effect on time and money to be negligible. 

“AI chatbots have had no significant impact on earnings or recorded hours in any occupation,” economists Anders Humlum and Emilie Vestergaard wrote in a National Bureau of Economic Research working paper released this week. 

Humlum, an assistant professor of economics at the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business, and Emilie Vestergaard, an economics PhD student at the University of Copenhagen, looked at 25,000 workers across 7,000 workspaces, focusing on occupations believed to be susceptible to disruption by AI: accountants, customer support specialists, financial advisors, HR professionals, IT support specialists, journalists, legal professionals, marketing professionals, office clerks, software developers, and teachers. 

They pulled records from Denmark, a country whose rates of AI adoption as well as hiring and firing practices are similar to those in the U.S. but where record-keeping is far more detailed, allowing the study to anonymously match survey responses to records of actual hours and pay.

On average, users of AI at work had a time savings of 3%, the researchers found. Some saved more time, but didn’t see better pay, with just 3%-7% of productivity gains being passed on to paychecks. 

In other words, while they found no mass displacement of human workers, neither did they see transformed productivity or hefty raises for AI-wielding superworkers.

“While adoption has been rapid, with firms now heavily invested in unlocking the technological potential, the economic impacts remain small,” the authors write.

Productivity, interrupted

The findings might be a surprise against the backdrop of aggressive corporate adoption of AI: from Duolingo replacing its contract workers with AI to Shopify decreeing it will only hire humans as a second choice to AI. Meanwhile, investors have been bidding up shares of companies involved in AI. 

But the NBER paper doesn’t mean that earlier findings of AI’s productivity boost have been wrong, said Humlum—just incomplete.

Most of the earlier research has focused “exactly on the occupations where the time savings are largest,” Humlum told Fortune. 

“Software, writing code, writing marketing tasks, writing job posts for HR professionals—these are the tasks the AI can speed up. But in a broader occupational survey, where AI can still be helpful, we see much smaller savings,” he said.

Other factors that explain AI’s overall ho-hum impact include employer buy-in and employees’ own time management.

“I might save time drafting an email using a large language model, so I save some time there, but the important question is, what do I use that time savings for?” he said. “Is the marginal task I’m shifting my work toward a productive task?” 

Workers in the study allocated more than 80% of their saved time to other work tasks (less than 10% said they took more breaks or leisure time), including new tasks created by the use of AI, such as editing AI-generated copy, or, in Humlum’s own case, adjusting exams to make sure that students aren’t using AI to cheat. 

There’s also the fact that real workplaces are much messier than structured experiments. 

“In the real world, many workers are using these tools without even the endorsement of the boss. Some don’t even know if they’re allowed to use it; some are allowed but not really encouraged to use it,” Humlum said. “In a workplace where it’s not explicitly encouraged, there’s limited space to go to your boss and say, ‘I’d like to take on more work because AI has made me more productive,’” let alone negotiate for higher pay based on higher productivity.

And of course, employees might not want to advertise how much more productive AI has made them, especially considering the well-trod adage that the reward for efficient workers is more work. 

Some of the findings around hours and pay in workplaces where AI isn’t used “suggest that workers are not exactly knocking on the boss’s door asking for more work,” Humlum said. 

Great expectations, mid results

The NBER paper comes on the heels of other indications suggesting that AI’s potential, while tremendous, has been vastly overstated in the media and the market. 

Payment processor Klarna, which made waves last year when it revealed it stopped hiring humans in favor of a super-productive AI, recently tempered its rhetoric. 

An IBM survey of 2,000 CEOs revealed that just 25% of AI projects deliver on their promised return on investment. The main driver of adoption, it seems, is corporate FOMO, with nearly two-thirds of CEOs agreeing that “the risk of falling behind drives them to invest in some technologies before they have a clear understanding of the value they bring to the organization,” according to the study.

Nobel laureate Daron Acemoglu, who has extensively researched automation and labor, estimates AI’s productivity boost at approximately 1.1% to 1.6% of GDP in the next decade—a sizable boost for an advanced economy like the U.S., but far from the doubling of GDP some technologists have predicted. 

The danger with AI is that “the hype will likely go on for a while and do much more damage in the process than experts are anticipating,” he wrote for Fortune last year. In fact, “getting productivity gains from any technology requires organizational adjustment, a range of complementary investments, and improvements in worker skills, via training and on-the-job learning,” he said.

That’s a finding backed up by Humlum and Vestegaard, whose paper showed greater productivity gains when employers encouraged AI use and trained workers in it. 

It could also be just a matter of time. After all, the Industrial Revolution went on for a century, transforming how people lived and worked long after the invention of the steam engine. 

“It took a couple decades to see that we can have an assembly line powered by electricity instead of having everything run centrally via a steam engine,” Humlum said.

2024-05-03,823,Put my foot down and refused to go ahead with what would amount to almost 8 hours of interviews for a senior data scientist position.,"I've also said no to an organization's extensive interview process and they were similarly baffled.

If it is a position I am very interested in due to the work, pay, etc... I will jump through some hoops... But there IS a limit.

Edit:

To be fair, for my most recent role, I probably spent around 9 hours in total during the interview process across a few weeks.

- Screening call with recruiter ~ 20 mins
- Live coding + general DS topics interview ~ 40 mins
- Take-home Case Study ~ 4 hours
- Case Study review ~ 1 hour
- Informal Dinner with management ~ 2 hours
- Informal introduction to second C-suite exec ~ 20 mins
- Multiple short touch bases with recruiter throughout process ~ 20 mins total

The only reason I was willing to jump through these hoops was because the position genuinely seemed like a fantastic fit for me and the pay was a significant increase from my last job (which I was growing more discontented with every day). And so far... I love my new position and am very happy I was willing to put in the effort.","I just did:

0.5 hour initial interview

Take home project that probably took 2-3 hours

4 back-to-back 0.5 hour interviews

1 hour in person interview to review take home project

So 6ish hours for senior/lead position. Was told they’d have a decision today so I guess we’ll see 😬

EDIT: Didn’t get the job but did get an offer for a position I did 1 30 minute interview for 🥴 so I guess the moral of the story is be more like OP.

EDIT 2: Appreciate everyone’s support ❤️","I recall a Bloomberg recruiter asking me if I could commit to an interview process with 7 rounds. Not sure if their process is the same, but I was honest and said I didn't have that kinda time.

They still don't really have a way to address the largest issue which is that it can be tremendously hard to maximize machine utilization in python due to the GIL, and doing so requires time-consuming backflips to avoid python code. 

All I want is to saturate my workstation's cores when processing data, every time, without having to think about it.

I completed a MS in Applied Data Science for gobs of time and money and then completed two Google Data Analytics certs (the regular and advanced) and found the certs to be way more valuable in terms of useful tools and skills taught.,"> If a DS course doesn’t have at least one serious course in statistics, any SQL, and doesn’t make you solve real programming problems, it's no good.

I've been looking at 2-3 different online MS-DS programs from accredited non-profits.  After weeding out programs that were a bad fit or didn't look serious, all of the remaining possibilities require courses in statistics and SQL.  I'd have to look again, but I don't think any of them are advertised as 1 year programs.  I can't speak to whether they make you solve real programming problems or not at this point.

So, this raises 2 questions for me:

1.  What do you consider to be a prestigious university and where's the cutoff before it becomes too undistinguished, and therefor a scam in your opinion?
2. If the university isn't prestigious by your definition, but they do require significant coursework in statistics and SQL, and aren't advertised as 1 year programs, how likely are they to be a scam?"

If you're really so career focused that you have the blinders on 24/7 for real life, idk maybe talk to a therapist, or try getting a hobby/volunteering. At worst, you might become a more well rounded and interesting person. At best you might be more efficient at work and probably a more pleasant co-worker.

2024-01-24,573,New grad's job hunt in for a Data Analyst role in Canada,"About me: 

Double major in Applied Math + Economics, ~3.0 gpa, no internships, lots of relevant extracurriculars + tech club leadership positions with 3 projects in data analytics, offer from one of the big 5 banks in Canada in the Financial Intelligence Unit as a data analyst.

Watch out for positions that offer you ""training"", they'll ask money from you. 🙄

Edit: Some more information based on the questions below: 

- I started applying around early December. I got a call for the role right after New Years.

- I mainly used Linkedin to search for roles like Junior Data Analyst, Business Analyst, Risk Analyst

- This market is very bad, usually a new grad with 0 YOE could get an interview that required 1-2 YOE, I heard absolutely nothing back from those positions

- My projects:

1. machine learning project that took used a very popular videogame API to fetch player data to be pipelined into a tensorflow neural network, to predict a winning team

2. EDA + customer segmentation analysis on dataset on an ecommerce data, where I used SQL to aggregate data and then used that dataset in R to perform analysis. Showed results on PowerBI. 

3. Fraud Detection on credit card data with kNN, improved classification with SMOTE technique. Displayed results and performance of the classification algorithm with Tableau.

Other tips: 

- try to pick up some really basic level of HTML + CSS, and make your own portfolio website with HTML templates and show off your projects. Presentation is half the battle. It doesn't need to look complicated, just make it nice and neat. I got my templates from here: https://html5up.net/

- Try to make a project that is an ""end to end"" solution for something. 

- show some flair in your projects by doing something that interests you (mine was videogames, project #1), it shows personality

I’m sorry you have a hard time with your boss. That sucks. Below is my recommendation based on how I’ve navigated similar circumstances. My boss was eventually rolled off of my work onto other work. 


Here is how I’d play it: set up time for a check in. Acknowledge that your work is not always exactly what your boss wants, and request **actionable** feedback. Ask questions such as “How can I better understand your expectations?” Or “Is there something you feel I’m consistently missing?” And **write down the answers.**

Then you follow up with an email describing everything you heard. Thank your boss for the feedback and commit to implementing it. End it with “please correct me if I’ve misunderstood anything you’ve said.”

You now have documented evidence of the feedback. This is your safety net and it’s a way to “pin” your boss on a set of requirements. You can refer back to this feedback as you work. If your boss continues to change expectations, then you can find time with a common supervisor (your boss’ boss) and describe the issues.

2023-09-08,487,R vs Python - detailed examples from proficient bilingual programmers,"From my experience **Python excels** (vs R) when you move to writing production-grade code:

- in my experience base Python (dicts, lists, iterating strings letter by letter) are much faster than base types in R
- better OOP system than R's set of S3/S4/R6
- function decorators
- context managers
- asynchronous i/o
- type hinting and checking (R has a package typing that has something along these lines but nowhere to the level what Python has in terms of say Pydantic and mypy)
- far more elaborate set of linting tools, e.g. black and flake8 trump anything in R
- new versions and features coming far more quickly than R
- data orchestration/automation tools that work out of the box, e.g. Airflow, Prefect (stupid easy learning curve, slap few decorators and you have your workflow)
- version pinning, e.g. pyenv, poetry,  basically reproducible workflows
- massive community support, unlike R, Python doesn't rely on one company (Posit) and bunch of academics to keep it alive. 
- FAANG companies have interest in developing not only Python packages but language itself, even more so with Global Interpreter Lock removal
- web scraping, interfacing with various APIs even as common as AWS is a lot smoother in Python
- PySpark >>> SparkR/sparklyr
- PyPI >>> CRAN (CRAN submission is like a bad joke from stone age,  CRAN doesn't support Linux binaries(!!!)


**R excels** in maybe lower number of other places, typically statistical tools, specific-domain support (e.g. bioinformatics/comp bio) and exploratory data analysis, but in things it is better it is just *so good*:

- the number of stats packages is far beyond anything in Python
- the number of bioinformatics packages is FAR beyond Python (especially on Bioconductor)
- tidyverse (dplyr/tidyr especially) destroys every single thing I tried in Python, pandas here looks like a bad joke in comparison
- delayed evaluation, especially in function arguments, results in some crazy things you can do wrt metaprogramming (e.g. package rlang is incredible, allows you to easily take the user provided code apart, supplement it, then just evaluate it in whatever environment you want... which I am sure breaks bunch of good coding practices but damn is it useful) 
- data.table syntax way cleaner than polars (again thanks to clever implementation of tidy evaluation and R-specific features)
- Python's plotnine is good, but ggplot2 is still king - the number of additional gg* packages allows you to make some incredible visualizations that are very hard to do in Python
- super-fluid integration with RMarkdown (although now Quarto is embracing Python so this point may be moot)
- even though renv is a little buggy in my experience, RStudio/Posit Package Manager is fantastic
- RStudio under very active development and IDE for exploratory work is in some specific ways better than anything for Python including VSCode (e.g. it recognizes data.frame/data.table/tibble contexts and column names and previews are available via tabbing)","I wouldn’t build a web server with R. But anything with statistics I would use R. Practically, I would use python for data acquisition. Web scraping, API interaction, automated SQL stuff.

“OK… now recite verbatim page 431 from Cassella  and Berger. Alright… now code a decision tree from scratch. Nice… here is a BFS medium problem, you have five minutes. Perfect… lets finish with coding up cross entropy loss”","I'm currently interviewing for Sr. ML roles

the last spot I interviewed had a sort of generic ""ML fundamentals"" style interview -- i.e. you'll be asked some things about ML techniques and describe a project you worked on. 

entire interview was maybe 55 minutes, around 45 of which I spent going over a huge project I completed at my last job -- me and the interviewer had a great conversation (even he said so!). he then pauses me at the end and asks a question about how logistic regression works. 

note: I did not express any sort of meaningful devotion to logistic regression in my discussion; I mentioned that I had used it before to get a base level of performance but beyond that it's just not something I'm using often (I also cannot remember the last time a logistic regression was put into production... but I digress). 

I answer his question by going a bit into what the parameters mean, when you'd use logistic regression, etc. I admit I didn't give him anything particularly detailed but, remember, I had just spent 45 minutes talking about a project that *did not use logistic regression*; my mind was tired from being 'on'.

I leave the interview feeling pretty great! like the interviewer ultimately said in his feedback (which the recruiter summarized and shared with me), it was a good chat and he was impressed with my knowledge and skills!

... except I didn't pass the interview. 

why? because I didn't highlight that logistic regression can be/is optimized using gradient descent. 

I wish I was kidding, but I'm not. I was (and still am, honestly) pretty irked by the situation. it gave big 'rote memorization is key!' energy. 

note, I'm not mad at them for asking me the question; it wasn't some bullshit 'gotcha!' style question/brain teaser that were so popular back in the day. my issue is that, if the entire interview is going to revolve around whether or not I answer some (in my mind, inane) question about logistic regression -- *regardless* of what my project was and *regardless* of the knowledge I demonstrated elsewhere -- just fucking ask that question at the start and end the interview early if the person doesn't answer it 'correctly'! do you know how shitty it feels to spend 45 minutes highlighting something you've done only to, in the span of 3-5 minutes, 'fail' some kind of test? not great, Bob. not great. 

I'd also hope that, in this day and age, people would realize that just because someone doesn't offer up some phrase/concept when you ask them a question doesn't mean they don't know anything about it. I could've talked the guy's ears off about gradient descent had I known that's the direction he was looking but instead he just kind of nodded and agreed with what I said about logistic regression and went from there. 

now, maybe there were some other reasons the interviewer provided (that weren't submitted with the recruiter-summarized feedback) as to not passing me. if that's the case, well... it would have been good to know so I could modify how I describe my projects going forward."
