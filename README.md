# Foundational ML-DS projects

A compact portfolio of five self-contained projects, based on end-to-end machine-learning and data-science case studies. Each folder holds raw data (or source links), exploratory jupyter notebooks, trained ML models, and a short PDF report for most of them so you can understand the results and reuse the code.

| Project                               | Goal & Data                                                                                                     | Techniques                                                                    | Key Assets                                                                            |
