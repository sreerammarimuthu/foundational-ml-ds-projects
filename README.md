# Foundational ML-DS projects

A compact portfolio of five self-contained projects, based on foundational end-to-end machine-learning and data-science case studies. Each folder holds it's own project with raw data (or source links), exploratory jupyter notebooks, trained ML models, and a short PDF report for most of them so you can understand the results and reuse the code.
